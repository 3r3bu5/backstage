Welcome. Take a seat. You're at the Scaffolder Documentation.

So - You wanna create stuff inside your company from some prebaked templates? You're at the right place.

This guide is gonna take you through how the Scaffolder in Backstage works. Both the frontend, and the backend. At it's core, theres 3 simple stages.

1) Pick a skeleton

2) Template some variables into the skeleton

3) Send the templated skeleton somewhere

Underneath, theres a little bit more going on.
